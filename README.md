# mkignore

_created by Austin Poor_

A CLI for building project `.gitignore` files using the templates in the [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
directory.

This project is inspired by the feature in the `gh` CLI -- but I wanted to be able to make (or update) `.gitignore` files
at any time and to have the option to merge multiple template files.
